I'm Leonardo, a PhD student in the Biology department at New York University. 

Currently working with mathematical epidemiology.

Most of the code I'm involved in are made public at [ObservatÃ³rio COVID-19 BR](https://github.com/covid19br) and [Pascual's Group at NYU](https://github.com/pascualgroup).
